## Summary/Overview :memo:

- Deployed on AWS with Infrastructure as Code on [CDK-TypeScript](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).
- Implemented custom CTFd solution [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd).
- Containerized solution with [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
- Load Balancing managed with [ELB - Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) pointing to the EC2 instances.

## Dependencies :100:

### Software

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <br>
  Visual Studio Code is my main code editor for high-level programming. This is not absolutely necessary, but from my experience, it gives us a great performance and we can link it with Git and GitHub easily. <br>

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) <br>
  NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine programming language. The community is amazing and lets us handle async functionalities in elegant ways. <br>

### Tools

- [CDK CLI (Toolkit)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html) <br>
  To work with the CDK, it is important to install the main toolkit as a NodeJs global dependency. Please refer to the official AWS [Getting started with the AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)<br>

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) <br>
  The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. We will use it for connecting to our AWS account from the terminal (authentication and authorization towards AWS). <br>

## Special thanks :beers:

- I am grateful to the talented individuals who have dedicated their time and effort to develop the exceptional open-source projects that have been used in the creation of this solution. <br>
